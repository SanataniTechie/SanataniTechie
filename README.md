# 🕉️ Sonatoni App

**A Digital Companion for Sanatan Dharma**

---

## ✨ Our Vision

Sonatoni is a movement to bring the timeless essence of **Sanatan Dharma** into the digital age.

We aim to create an immersive spiritual experience through mobile-first innovation that inspires, informs, and connects the global dharmic community. Our approach is rooted in **faith, functionality, and cultural respect** — ensuring every soul finds tools that support their path, their rituals, and their growth.

## 🙏 Our Motive

In a time when attention is fragmented and content is overwhelming, Sonatoni aspires to be a sacred space — a **spiritual sanctuary in your pocket**. We’re not just building an app; we’re **curating dharma**, preserving tradition, and facilitating daily devotion for modern lives.

We believe in:
- Empowering every individual with access to authentic dharmic content
- Supporting temples, teachers, and traditions through digital tools
- Creating safe spaces for learning, devotion, and community
